	Implemented .xs file munging and source-filter to be able to truly
	support forks.pm under Perl 5.6.x.  Thanks to Juerd Waalboer for the
	idea of the source filter.

	It is now confirmed that forks.pm won't work under 5.005, so the
	minimum version of Perl is now set to 5.6.0 in the Makefile.PL.

	Tested under 5.8.1-RC4.  The WHOA! messags seem to have disappeared
	but instead a warning has appeared that cannot be suppressed.  This
	was caused by my attempt to activate the :shared attribute.  Since
	that doesn't work anyway, I removed the offending code and the
	warning went away.

	Fixed some warnings in the test-suite.

	Fixed another warning in forks.pm.  Reported by Bradley W. Langhorst.

	Added dummy -package forks- to forks.pm to fool CPAN into thinking
	it really is the forks.pm module, when in fact it is of course
	threads.pm.

	Fixed some warnings in t/forks01.t.

	Made sure length packing uses Network order.

	First public version of forks.pm.  Thanks to Lars Fenneberg for all
	the help so far.
