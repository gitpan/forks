	Shared entities that were also blessed as an object, were not
	correctly handled (ref() versus Scalar::Util::reftype() ).  Spotted
	by Jack Steadman.  Now fixed by using reftype() rather than ref().

	Dependency on Scalar::Util added (not sure when that became core).
	Added tests to excercise Thread::Queue (if available).

	10 October 2003
	Changed async() to make it a little faster by removing an extra call
	from the stack.

0.07	27 September 2003
	Added error detection in case lock or cond_xxx were called on unshared
	variables or cond_xxx were called on an unlocked variable.  Added tests
	for it in the test-suite.

	Added dummy package declaration to forks::shared.pm for CPAN's sake.
	Cleaned up the attribute handler code in forks::shared.pm a bit.

	Finally grokked the documentation about attributes.  This allowed me
	to finally write the handler for the ":shared" attribute.  Which in
	the end turned out to be surprisingly simple.

	Adapted the test-suite to test usage of the ":shared" attribute as
	opposed to sharing variables with the "share" subroutine.

0.05	26 September 2003
	Increased dependency on load.pm to 0.11: versions of load.pm before
	that had issues with running under taint.

	Debug statements can now be activated by setting the environment
	variable THREADS_DEBUG to true.  As this is still experimental, this
	feature is only described in the CHANGELOG for now.

	Fixed several issues when running under taint.  Test-suite now runs
	in tainted mode just to be on the safe side.

	Removed some debug statements from the test-suite.

	Implemented .xs file munging and source-filter to be able to truly
	support forks.pm under Perl 5.6.x.  Thanks to Juerd Waalboer for the
	idea of the source filter.

	It is now confirmed that forks.pm won't work under 5.005, so the
	minimum version of Perl is now set to 5.6.0 in the Makefile.PL.

	Tested under 5.8.1-RC4.  The WHOA! messags seem to have disappeared
	but instead a warning has appeared that cannot be suppressed.  This
	was caused by my attempt to activate the :shared attribute.  Since
	that doesn't work anyway, I removed the offending code and the
	warning went away.

	Fixed some warnings in the test-suite.

	Fixed another warning in forks.pm.  Reported by Bradley W. Langhorst.

0.03	2 April 2003
	Fixed a warning in forks.pm.  Reported by Bradley W. Langhorst.

0.02	17 January 2003
	Added dummy -package forks- to forks.pm to fool CPAN into thinking
	it really is the forks.pm module, when in fact it is of course
	threads.pm.

	Fixed some warnings in t/forks01.t.

	28 October 2002
	Made sure length packing uses Network order.

0.01	27 October 2002
	First public version of forks.pm.  Thanks to Lars Fenneberg for all
	the help so far.
